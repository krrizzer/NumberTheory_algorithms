# NumberTheory_algorithms
Implementing some of the Number theory algorithms on Python
the algorthims are : 
1- gcd function using the Euclidean Algorithm gcd(a,b).  
2- test function is_prime (n, k) based on Fermat Little Theorem, where n is the number to be tested, and k is the number of bases to be used
3-Mersenne prime: is a prime number of the form Mp = 2p â€“ 1
4-modular exponentiation (a.k.a. fast exponentiation) function mod_exp (b, n, m) to compute bn (mod m) more efficiently
5-Modify your is_prime function to use the mod_exp (b, n, m) instead of the standard power operation (b**n % m). Rename it as is_prime2. Modify the mersenne (p) function to use is_prime2, and call it mersenne2.
